# PATIENT-CHURN-PREDICTION
The project is aimed to study patient retention patterns and build predictive models to identify patients at risk of leaving a healthcare provider.


This Patient Churn dataset represents synthetic healthcare data of 500 patients designed for churn prediction and machine learning analysis. Each record contains demographic details like Age and Gender, along with service-related features such as Tenure in months, number of hospital Visits in the last year, presence of Chronic Disease, and type of Insurance. It also includes behavioral and financial indicators like Satisfaction Score, Total Bill Amount, and number of Missed Appointments. The target column, Churn, indicates whether a patient has stopped using the hospital’s services (1 = churned, 0 = active).
